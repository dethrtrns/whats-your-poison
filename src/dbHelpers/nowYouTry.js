//import mongoose

//create a new database named playersdb and connect to it.

//define the schema here as per instructions below
//->each document of this collection(players) should have the fields:-
// name*, age*, sports*(which could be more than one for a player), location*(a pair of long & lat coords), imgUrl(optional), isProfessional(also optional, just a true or false value), joinedOn*(should automatically be generated and stored,date when the document was created)

//now create a model for the above schema such that a collection is created in the db named 'players'

//now define reusable functions for the following:
//->adding a new player.
//->getting all players.
//->getting a single player by name(received in args).
//->getting all players who play a particular sport(recieved in args).
//->getting all pro players who are under 19 years old.
//->updating the name and imgUrl(recieved via args)
//->deleting a player of given id.

// => define the functions statically first and test them.
//    then modify them later to be used via args.
